# slan-cuan

Release pipeline for Red Hat Lightwell's Java artifacts. Extracts artifacts from PNC container images, signs them, registers SBOMs and attestations, and publishes to Pulp for distribution via `packages.redhat.com`.

Packaged as a container image that provides both the Python CLI application and Tekton Task definitions for Konflux pipeline orchestration.
